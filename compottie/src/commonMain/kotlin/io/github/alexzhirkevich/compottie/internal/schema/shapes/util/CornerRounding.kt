/**
 * CornerRounding defines the amount and quality around a given vertex of a shape.
 * [radius] defines the radius of the circle which forms the basis of the rounding for the
 * vertex. [smoothing] defines the amount by which the curve is extended from the circular
 * arc around the corner to the edge between vertices.
 *
 * Each corner of a shape can be thought of as either:
 * <em>
 *     <li> unrounded (with a corner radius of 0 and no smoothing) </li>
 *     <li> rounded with only a circular arc (with smoothing of 0). In this case, the rounding
 *     around the corner follows an approximated circular arc between the edges to adjacent
 *     vertices. </li>
 *     <li> rounded with three curves: There is an inner circular arc and two symmetric flanking
 *     curves. The flanking curves determine the curvature from the inner curve to the edges,
 *     with a value of 0 (no smoothing) meaning that it is purely a circular curve and a value of 1
 *     meaning that the flanking curves are maximized between the inner curve and the edges.
 * </em>
 *
 * @param radius a value of 0 or greater, representing the radius of the circle which defines
 * the inner rounding arc of the
 * corner. A value of 0 indicates that the corner is sharp, or completely unrounded. A positive
 * value is the requested size of the radius. Note that this radius is an absolute size that
 * should relate to the overall size of its shape. Thus if the shape is in screen coordinate
 * size, the radius should be sized appropriately. If the shape is in some canonical form
 * (bounds of (-1,-1) to (1,1), for example, which is the default when creating a [RoundedPolygon]
 * from a number of vertices), then the radius should be relative to that size. The radius will be
 * scaled if the shape itself is transformed, since it will produce curves which round the corner
 * and thus get transformed along with the overall shape.
 * @param smoothing the amount by which the arc is "smoothed" by extending the curve from
 * the inner circular arc to the edge between vertices. A value of 0 (no smoothing) indicates
 * that the corner is rounded by only a circular arc; there are no flanking curves. A value
 * of 1 indicates that there is no circular arc in the center; the flanking curves on either side
 * meet at the middle.
