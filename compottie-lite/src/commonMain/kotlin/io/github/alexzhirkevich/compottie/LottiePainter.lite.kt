/**
 * Create and remember Lottie painter
 *
 * @param composition [LottieComposition] usually created by [rememberLottieComposition]
 * @param progress animation progress from 0 to 1 usually derived from [animateLottieCompositionAsState]
 * @param assetsManager used to load animation assets that were not loaded during composition
 * initialization
 * @param fontManager used to load animation fonts
 * @param dynamicProperties dynamically-configurable animation properties. Can be created with
 * [rememberLottieDynamicProperties]
 * @param applyOpacityToLayers Sets whether to apply opacity to the each layer instead of shape.
 * Opacity is normally applied directly to a shape. In cases where translucent
 * shapes overlap, applying opacity to a layer will be more accurate at the expense of performance.
 * Note: Turning this on can be very expensive and sometimes can cause artifacts. Enable it only if
 * the animation have translucent overlapping shapes and always test if it works fine for your animation
 * @param clipToCompositionBounds if drawing should be clipped to the [composition].width X [composition].height rect
 * @param clipTextToBoundingBoxes if text should be clipped to its bounding boxes (if provided in animation)
 * @param enableTextGrouping disable line-to-char splitting. Enable this to correctly render texts
 * in locales such as Arabic. This feature forces to use fonts over glyphs and disables text tracking.
 * However, if you have texts rendered with fonts and don't use tracking, you can try enable this option
 * for any locales as this feature greatly improves texts performance
 * @param enableMergePaths enable experimental merge paths feature. Most of the time animation doesn't need
 * it even if it contains merge paths. This feature should only be enabled for tested animations
